      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        After working as a K-12 music educator, I have experience in education,
        communication, and public performance. I have practice breaking down
        problems for students, which will be useful for my learning and teaching
        others. My experience communicating with parents and administration will
        help me communicate more effectively with teams and clients. My
        experience in public performance means I am comfortable being creative
        and sharing my work with large audiences. Most impoartantly, I am
        excited to learn with others and solve problems with a team. I am
        confident that I can succeed at Prime Digital Academy.
